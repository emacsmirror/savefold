* savefold.el

This package is a family of global minor modes that persist folds made by
various existing overlay-based folding systems, saving them to the disk and
reapplying upon file open. Currently supported:

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Outline-Mode.html][outline mode]]
- [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] (only emacs 28/org 9.6 overlay folding, currently)

** Usage

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package savefold
  :init
  (setq savefold-backends '("outline" "org"))
  (setq savefold-directory (locate-user-emacs-file "savefold"))  ;; default

  :config
  (savefold-mode 1))
#+end_src
