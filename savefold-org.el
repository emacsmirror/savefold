;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements persistence for org-mode visibility.
;;
;; There are many types of folds in an org file that should be persisted:
;;
;; - section/outline folds
;; - blocks
;; - drawers
;; - babel results
;;
;; Under the traditional overlay-based ("old-fashioned") folding system, all of
;; these are folded as overlays. Section/outline overlays can be made to
;; identical effect with either outline-mode commands (ex
;; `outline-hide-subtree') or org commands (ex `org-hide-entry'); they identify
;; themselves via 'invisible spec as 'outline overlays. So do drawer folds. Thus
;; we defer to existing savefold-outline logic for recovering those. A separate,
;; org-specific system is built for persisting blocks and babel results.
;;
;; In the new text property based folding regime (org 9.6+), sections, blocks,
;; and drawers are folded with text properties, while babel results are still
;; overlay-based.
